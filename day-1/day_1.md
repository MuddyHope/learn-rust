Cargo is rust package manager. It downloads your rust packages dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages and upload them to crates?? (crates are rust community package registry)

cargo new <dir_name>

This is the structure

Cargo.toml → called the manifest and it contains all of the metadata that cargo needs to compile the package.

After edition the [main.rs](http://main.rs) file. 

cargo build → it will compile the package and create a binary crate.

we can also use cargo run 

rustc [hello.rs](http://hello.rs) also works.
